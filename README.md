# degpd-and-zidegpd
This "Fit_degpd_zidegpd.R" function will work to fit simply discrete extended generalized Pareto distribution (degpd) and zero-inflated discrete extended generalized Pareto distribution (zidegpd) with thier GAM forms as well. We are using the functions of evgam R package (Youngman, 2020) behind to run our own developed R code.
