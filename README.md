# degpd-and-zidegpd
This code will work to fit simply discrete extended generalized Pareto distribution (degpd) and zero-inflated discrete extended generalized Pareto distribution (zidegpd) with thier GAM forms as well. We are using the functions of evgam R package (Youngman, 2020) to run our own developed R code. 
'est_par =predict(m_degpd1, type = 'response')'
